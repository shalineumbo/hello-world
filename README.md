# hello-world
This is my first time using GitHub, and this is my first repository :)

I recently commited to learning how to code, I have been coding on and off since I was 15, I started with HTML, then learnt some python, but I never really had a proper grasp on programming.

My interest in computing and computers was rekindled during my first year of my BSc Mechanical Undergrad, which has led me to learn how computers work from the hardware up to and including embedded systems and software.
